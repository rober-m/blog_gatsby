## Why do we forget things?

Many people assume that they have poor memory because they forget things like their car keys or their friend's birthdays, but the brain is working as it should!

We humans didn't evolve millions of years to remember every single thing that happens to us. We evolved to survive. That means that the brain had to distinguish which information was relevant to our survival, remember it, and discard everything else to save resources. And this is roughly how the brain does it:

To encode memory, first, the information has to enter the [short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory) to store the data. This happens as soon as the person is exposed to the stimulus. The short-term memory is part of the [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), where the brain stores the information not just to store, but to manipulate it. In both processes, the data is lost almost as soon as the attention is shifted.

To make the transition to long-term memory, we have to [consolidate the memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation#Synaptic_consolidation). There are two types of memory consolidation:

- Synaptic Consolidation: This can be thought of as the prolonged strengthening of [synaptic transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_transmission), or in other words, the strengthening of the signal between the neurons.
- Systems Consolidation: This is a reorganization process in which memories from the [hippocampal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal) region, where memories are first [encoded](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_(memory)>), are moved to the [neo-cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-cortex) in a more permanent form of storage.

</figure>

Our objective is to consolidate the memory for future use, and now that we understand a little more about how the brain works, we can use this knowledge to optimize the learning process and remember anything for as long as we want.

## Prerequisites to knowledge building

The brain is a fine-tuned biological machine, and as such, it needs maintenance to perform optimally. Here is a quick summary of the three main prerequisites for optimal learning:

**Sleep quality and quantity** are [crucial to long-term memory consolidation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627304005409). So much so that **there is no long-term memory if there is no sleep**.

If you're not sure what to do, sleep for **8hs every night**, going to bed at the same time, and without a phone. Sounds counterintuitive but, **it's better to sleep well than to study more**. I will write more about this crucial subject in the future, but if you have the time, I'll recommend the book "Why we sleep" by Matthew Walker Ph.D. as a comprehensive source.

**Exercise** is alarmingly good at potentiating memory, energy, and productivity in general. Half to an hour of intense activity before learning can make all the difference in [cognitive capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition). On top of that, exercise reduces stress, anxiety, and depression<sup>[1]</sup>. Intense exercise does not mean a break-your-legs-running activity. With maintaining your heart rate reasonably high, it is enough. A more in-depth explanation can be found in the book "Spark" by John J. Ratey, or in future blog posts.

**Diet** is also an important aspect but not as straight forward as the other two. For proper performance of the brain, all the body has to be on point, and a well-balanced diet is needed. Which specific diet is something to discuss with your doctor. For general guidelines, the [world health organization](https://www.who.int/) has several [publications](https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/nutrient/en/) on the subject.

Ok, now that we are well-rested, well-fed, and well-exercised, we are ready to learn!

## The spacing effect and spaced repetition

<i>The **[spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect)** demonstrates that more information is encoded into [long-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory) by spaced study sessions ([spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)) than by massed presentation ([cramming](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramming_(education)>)).</i>

Let's see an example: Say you really want to remember an anniversary. One option is to sit down 10-20 mins to think, write, and shout the date as many times as you can. An investment of 10-20 minutes for retention of 2 or 3 months maximum (assuming you don't ever again think about the date).

The spacing effect demonstrates that is better if you only <u>**write**</u> the date **once** following a pattern of increasing time between reviews like:

**1 day -> 3 days -> 7 days -> 15 days -> 1 month -> 3 months -> 7 months**

And that's it, no more reviews because the next interval (the time it takes you to forget the date) is 14 months. Your memory will last more than the time it takes until the next organic interval (12 months)!

<figure>
	<img src="/media/500px-Spaced_repetition_Leitner_system_alternative.svg.png" alt="">
	<figcaption>In the Leitner system, correctly answered cards are advanced to the next, less frequent box, while incorrectly answered cards return to the first box for more aggressive review and repetition.</figcaption>
</figure>

With spaced repetition, you needed **5 seconds** per review (the time it takes to write down the date) **8 times**. So you learned the anniversary in **40 seconds total**, vast improvement if you ask me! Plus, what if there is a need to remember 20 dates? Not everybody can stop everything to cram for hours, but who can't spare a few seconds every day?

You might say:

- **What if I don't remember** the date in one of the reviews?
- What if instead of **writing**, I **read** the date?
- What about just adding the date to my calendar?

I agree that adding the date to your calendar is not a bad idea, but I'll address the other two questions as those are significant for every type of information, not just dates.

In the case that you can't recall the knowledge, there are several common ways to deal with it. Some methods make you start all over from the first interval (usually one day), and others use complex calculations to determine when the next review is due based on your previous performance and the current time interval. Luckily some tools (that we'll discuss below) can do this automatically for you, so don't worry about that.

Why do I have to write the date every time? Why not just read it?
Because reading is a passive review, and writing is an active recall. And let me tell you this: <u>**There's nothing like Active recall**</u>.

## Active recall and the Testing effect

<i>The **testing effect** is the finding that long-term memory is often improved when part of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information.</i>

This effect has been studied [since 1909](https://insights.ovid.com/psychological-monographs-general-applied/pmga/1909/11/010/analysis-factor-recall-learning-process/5/00006828), generating many hypotheses, studies, and experiments over the years that I will analyze in future articles. In summary, the empirical evidence indicates that the testing effect is remarkably powerful at generating memories.

The **practical application** of the testing effect it's called **active recall**. The objective of active recall is to actively stimulate memory during the learning process, strengthening long-term memory at every step.

The difference between active recall and passive review lies in the way the student acquires the information needed. If the student needs to retrieve knowledge from memory, it's active recall. If the student obtains the knowledge from external sources, it's a passive review.

Examples of **passive review**:

- Reading
- Watching videos
- Listening to a lecture

Examples of **active recall**:

- Writing from memory (not copying).
- Explaining a concept to another person.
- Imagining or drawing a chart or image (without looking).

Awesome! Now I know about spaced repetition and active recall. But, how do I apply these concepts in real life?

## How to apply all this in real life

This subject can be a complex one, and I know that you want the final answer. So here it is:

<i>**Use a [spaced repetition software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#List_of_spaced_repetition_software_programs) with [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) to actively recall the knowledge using the spacing effect and the testing effect simultaneously.**</i>

I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). It's the most popular software, it's [open-source](https://github.com/ankitects/anki), has a [sizable community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/) and functionalities ([including user-made add-ons](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1)), and it's free for all devices except for iPhones.

</figure

You can start taking advantage of all this almost instantly and for free! Now I will go through all the steps needed to create and study the flashcards on Anki.

<i>DISCLAIMER: This is an introductory guide. There are many details that I won't discuss in this article. Everything you need to know it's on the [Anki documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/), but if you have questions, you can write to me a my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/robertinomart) or ask at the [Anki community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/).</i>

1. Open Anki.
   ![](/media/Anki_homeScreen_Empty.png)
2. Click "Add" on the menu at the top.
   ![](/media/Anki_homeScreen_Empty_AddButton.png)
   ![](/media/Anki_addNote_Empty.png)
3. Add a precise and short question on the front and a concise one-concept answer to the back.
   ![](/media/Anki_addNote_Filled.png)
4. Click on the blue "Add" button below and done!
5. Now, on the main window (called "Decks"), Anki will show how many cards you have to review today.
   ![](/media/Anki_homeScreen_1NewCard.png)
6. Click on the name of the deck to start studying the flashcards.
7. When the front of a flashcard is displayed, you have to think the answer and click on the "show answer" button.
   ![](/media/Anki_question_commerciaNuclearReactors.png)
8. If you remembered correctly, click the "Good" button, else, click the "Again" button. When displayed, ignore the "Easy" and "Hard" buttons for now.
   ![](/media/Anki_answer_commerciaNuclearReactors.png)

That's it! Anki will make all the computations of when you will have to study each of the flashcards. You only have to keep doing flashcards until there is none left, every day.

And don't worry about "what happens if I do 100 or 1000 cards?!" If you do the flashcards correctly, you will do your daily reviews in a few minutes a day. My average review time is **9.5 minutes a day**, and my average interval is **6 months** between reviews (and I'm approaching **7k flashcards**, with subjects from civil engineering, programming, art, philosophy, foreign languages, business, investing, and the process of learning itself as a subject).

There is also a good rule of thumb to **which knowledge is worth reviewing** with this system. On average, a person will invest, in total, **less than 5 minutes** reviewing each card before the next review is in the afterlife (~8-10 seconds per review times ~30 reviews). So, if the knowledge is worth 5 minutes plus the time it takes you to write the flashcard, you are good to go!

As a final note, the most problematic aspect of all the process is making the cards correctly, so these are a few pointers to keep in mind:

<b>

- Create flashcards only about concepts that you understand.
- One concept per flashcard.
- Use imagery and mnemonic techniques.
- Provide context.
  </b>

For a complete explanation of how to write your flashcards, a safe place to start is Dr. Piotr Wozniak's article: [Twenty rules of formulating knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules).

## Conclusion

Now, we have a basic idea of how memory works, what can we do to remember forever, and how to apply this knowledge in practice.
With your new powers, as long as you keep reviewing, you can remember anything forever!
