## Civil engineer | Programmer | Entrepreneur

My name is Robertino Martinez, and I am a civil engineer and programmer working on several online businesses.

**When I was a kid**, I watched a documentary about the cosmic microwave background. I was so amazed by both the knowledge itself and the way that the scientist worked to find it that **I immediately fell in love with science and the scientific method**. With time, I develop the taste of not only wanting to know more but, to use that information to **solve real problems**. So I decided to become an engineer.

**In college, I started to code**. Making mobile apps for fun, soon I was caught by the endless possibilities of the programming world, and I started to learn everything I could:

- _Dart_ and _Flutter_ for mobile development.
- _Python_, _NumPy_, _Pandas_, and _TensorFlow_ for data science and machine learning.
- _HTML_,_CSS_,_JS_ and _React_ for web development.
- _Electron_ for Desktop development.

While studying engineering, programming, and science in general, **I became obsessed with understanding how the brain works, learns, and how we, as learners, can optimize our behavior**. As a result, it led me to have a better overall performance on life itself, and I'm grateful for that.

**I graduated as a Civil engineer** in February 2020 from the National University of Technology in Argentina by presenting as a thesis the analysis and development of an **LSTM neural network** that predicts the reservoir level of the San Roque damn several months in advance. Said model is now being used by the government to manage more efficiently the water resource and energy generation of the damn.

**Now, I'm immersing in the entrepreneurial world**; Reading books, starting businesses, and looking to solve interesting problems and help people. You can see what I'm currently working on the _projects section_, or contact me through any of the links below the menu.
